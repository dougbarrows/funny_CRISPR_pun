# funny_CRISPR_pun
PFB 2019 Final Project

Our project is centered around providing users with a set of possible guide RNA locations
for CRISPRa or CRISPRi given a set of gene IDs. 

The approach is split into three parts
1) linking genes and start sites
2) creating a set of possible guides for a given PAM sequence
3) cross-refencing the list of start sites with the list of possible guides
